# Coursera_Capstone.
 This notebook presents the data science capstone project. We introduce the context of the project and the different steps realized to do the work. 
 
 The first map contains the visualization of the various neighbourhoods in Canada whose borough has the word Toronto.
 
Itâ€™s a system that recommends where to set up a restaurant or a shop in
the city of Toronto using the K-means clustering algorithm to find
similarities between the different locations in the map. We used the
folium map library to visualize data analysis and the Foursquare APIs to
fetch the data from API calls.
